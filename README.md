# SIP-Project- A study of fabric production in Krishna Textile

# A Study on Fabric Production at Krishna Textile, Kadegaon

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing fabric production processes at Krishna Textile, Kadegaon, as part of an academic study for the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program at CSIBER, Kolhapur. The study examines production efficiency, resource utilization, and the impact of various factors on textile manufacturing.

# Objectives

Understand the production process and its key components.

Analyze resource allocation and material utilization.

Evaluate production efficiency using data visualization tools (Power BI).

Identify process optimization opportunities.

# Research Methodology

# Data Collection

Primary Data: Collected through observations, interviews with production managers, and field visits.

Secondary Data: Gathered from company records (2017-2022), industry reports, and academic literature.

# Tools Used

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

Excel: For statistical analysis and trend identification.

# Key Findings

# Production Efficiency

Average efficiency from 2017-2022 was 87.65%.

Fabric production fluctuated due to factors such as market demand and raw material availability.

# Resource Utilization

Warp requirement was significantly lower in 2019-20, indicating a possible supply chain issue.

Weft requirement was consistently higher than warp, affecting fabric texture and quality.

# Trends in Fabric Production

Fabric production peaked in 2020-21 at 1,440,531 meters and was lowest in 2019-20 at 925,709.5 meters.

Yarn usage showed inefficiencies, with some production losses observed.

# Suggestions for Improvement

Process Optimization: Implement better production planning to reduce waste and improve efficiency.

Weaving Enhancements: Explore twill or satin weaves to balance warp and weft usage.

Supply Chain Strengthening: Expand supplier networks to mitigate raw material shortages.

Technology Adoption: Use automation and advanced weaving techniques for better control over production.

# Conclusion

The study highlights key trends and areas for improvement in fabric production at Krishna Textile. By optimizing processes, enhancing resource utilization, and adopting advanced technology, the company can improve efficiency and maintain competitiveness in the textile industry.
